# atheart

atheart will be a simple Python-based CLI tool to control the proprietary features of the ATH-SR50BT headphones, previously limited
to the official iOS/Android apps.

## Motivation

It's a bit annoying to have to touch twice in a row to switch from "Noise Reduction" to "Off". Also, keeping an eye on the battery level could be cool.

## Features

- [x] Support "get/set microphone mode" call
- [x] Support "set voice control status" call
- [ ] Support "get battery level" call
- [ ] Fix bug with (unclosed connections?)
